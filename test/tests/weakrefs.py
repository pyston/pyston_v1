# from https://docs.python.org/2/library/weakref.html:
#
# Not all objects can be weakly referenced; those objects which can include class instances, functions written in Python (but not in C), methods (both bound and unbound), sets, frozensets, file objects, generators, type objects, DBcursor objects from the bsddb module, sockets, arrays, deques, regular expression pattern objects, and code objects.
#
# Changed in version 2.4: Added support for files, sockets, arrays, and patterns.
#
# Changed in version 2.7: Added support for thread.lock, threading.Lock, and code objects
#
# Several built-in types such as list and dict do not directly support weak references but can add support through subclassing
#
# CPython implementation detail: Other built-in types such as tuple and long do not support weak references even when subclassed
#
