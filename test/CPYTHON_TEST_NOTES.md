These are rntz's notes from trying to get the CPython testing framework to run,
for future reference.

## Bugs uncovered
The CPython tests I've included fail for various reasons. Recurring issues include:
- use of `compile()`
- missing `__hash__` implementations for some builtin types
- we don't have `imp.get_magic()`
- segfaults
- missing `__name__` attributes on capifuncs
- missing `sys.__stdout__` attribute
- `serialize_ast.cpp`: `writeColOffset: assert(v < 100000 || v == -1)` gets tripped
- `src/runtime/util.cpp`: `parseSlice`: `assert(isSubclass(start->cls, int_cls) || start->cls == none_cls)`

### Getting regrtest to work is hard
regrtest works by `__import__()ing` the tests to be run and then doing some stuff.
This means that if even a single test causes pyston to crash or assert(), the
whole test-runner dies.

The best fix for this would be to simply run each test in a separate pyston
process. It's not clear to accomplish this without breaking the tests, however,
because Python's test support is a big, gnarly piece of code. In particular, it
will skip tests based on various criteria, which we probably want to support.
But it's not clear how to disentangle that knowledge from the way it `__import__`s
the tests.

So instead I ran regrtest manually, looked at what tests it ran, and imported
those. tester.py will run them separately.

### Obsolete notes: Hacking regrtest to manually change directories
Need to run test/regrtest.py for testing harness; The standard way to do this in
CPython is `python -m test.regrtest` from Lib/. The -m is important because
otherwise it can't find the tests properly. Turns out implementing the -m flag
is hard, because the machinery for imports is pretty complicated and there's no
easy way to ask it "which file *would* I load to import this module". So I
hacked regrtest to manually change directories.

### Obsolete FIXME for regrtest.py: CFG/analysis bug with osr
test/regrtest.py trips an assert in PropagatingTypeAnalysis::getTypeAtBlockStart
if not run with -I, looks like malformed CFG or bug in analysis
* tests are slow
CPython's tests are pretty slow for us. In particular, since we're not running
with regrtest, we have to go through the set-up time of loading
test.test_support for each test. On my machine it's that's about a half-second
per test.

To handle this, by default we don't run tests marked "expected: fail". To
disable this, pass --all-cpython-tests to tester.py.
