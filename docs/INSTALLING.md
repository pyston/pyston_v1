Pyston currently only supports installing from source; the following instructions have only been tested on Ubuntu, but should ideally work on a Mac as well.

Pyston expects to find all of its dependencies in ~/pyston_deps:
```
mkdir ~/pyston_deps
```

### Compiler for clang

clang requires a fairly modern [host compiler](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#host-c-toolchain-both-compiler-and-standard-library), so typically you will have to install a new one.  The easiest thing to do is to just create a fresh build of GCC:

```
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev make build-essential libtool zip gcc-multilib autogen
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget 'http://www.netgull.com/gcc/releases/gcc-4.8.2/gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2'
tar xvf gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2
mkdir gcc-4.8.2-{build,install}
cd gcc-4.8.2-build
# Space- and time-saving configuration:
../gcc-4.8.2/configure --disable-bootstrap --enable-languages=c,c++ --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install
# full configuration:
# ../gcc-4.8.2/configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### ccache

ccache is a build tool that can help speed up redundant compilations.  It's not strictly necessary but it's useful enough to be enabled by default; you can disable it by adding `USE_CCACHE := 0` to your Makefile.local.  To get it, run:
```
sudo apt-get install ccache
```

### LLVM dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### LLVM + clang

LLVM and clang depend on a pretty modern compiler; the steps below assume you installed GCC 4.8.2 as described above.  It should be possible to build using clang >= 3.1, such as what you might find on a Mac, but that will require changes to the way LLVM is configured (specified in src/Makefile) that I haven't tested.

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git llvm-trunk
git clone http://llvm.org/git/clang.git llvm-trunk/tools/clang
cd ~/pyston/src
make llvm_up
make llvm_configure
make llvm -j4
```

There seem to be some lingering issues with the LLVM build that haven't been identified yet; if the last step fails with errors along the lines of "rm: could not find file foo.tmp", it is quite likely that simply running it again will cause it to continue successfully.  You may have to do this multiple times, unfortunately.

### libunwind

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/libunwind/libunwind-1.1.tar.gz
tar xvf libunwind-1.1.tar.gz
mkdir libunwind-1.1-install
cd libunwind-1.1
# disable shared libraries because we'll be installing this in a place that the loader can't find it.
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/libunwind-1.1-install --enable-shared=0
patch -p1 <~/pyston/libunwind_patches/0001-Change-the-RBP-validation-heuristic-to-allow-size-0-.patch
make -j4
make install
```

TODO would be nice to install this locally like the rest of the dependencies

### valgrind

Pyston currently has a build-time dependency on valgrind headers, for adding hooks to its custom memory allocator.  (TODO add a flag to enable this since it's normally not used.)  To satisfy this, do:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.9.0.tar.bz2
tar xvf valgrind-3.9.0.tar.bz2
```

If you'd like to run valgrind, we recommend building this 3.9.0 release, since some older versions (such as what are in the Ubuntu 12.04 apt repositories) aren't new enough.  To finish installing, assuming you ran the above steps:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
mkdir valgrind-3.9.0-install
cd valgrind-3.9.0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/valgrind-3.9.0-install
make -j4
make install
sudo apt-get install libc6-dbg
```

Then, add this line to your Makefile.local:
```
VALGRIND := VALGRIND_LIB=$(HOME)/pyston_deps/valgrind-3.9.0-install/lib/valgrind $(HOME)/pyston_deps/valgrind-3.9.0-install/bin/valgrind
```

# Optional dependencies

### Debug build of libunwind

Assuming you've already built the normal version above:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
cp -rv libunwind-1.1 libunwind-1.1-debug
mkdir ../libunwind-1.1-debug-install
cd libunwind-1.1-debug
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/libunwind-1.1-debug-install --enable-shared=0 --enable-debug --enable-debug-frame
make -j4
make install
echo "USE_DEBUG_LIBUNWIND := 1" >> ~/pyston/src/Makefile.local
```

This will link pyston_dbg and pyston_debug against the debug version of libunwind (the release pyston build will still link against the release libunwind); to enable debug output, set the UNW_DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable, ex to 13.

### distcc
```
sudo apt-get install distcc distcc-pump
```

You can then use distcc by doing `make USE_DISTCC=1`

### gtest

For running the unittests, though all the unittests are currently disabled:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.7.0.zip
unzip gtest-1.7.0.zip
cd gtest-1.7.0
./configure CXXFLAGS=-fno-omit-frame-pointer
make -j4
```

### gdb
A new version of gdb is highly recommended since debugging a JIT tends to stress GDB:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.6.2.tar.gz
tar xvf gdb-7.6.2.tar.gz
cd gdb-7.6.2
./configure
make -j4
```

Then add this to your Makefile.local:
```
GDB := $(HOME)/pyston_deps/gdb-7.6.2/gdb/gdb
```

### gperftools (-lprofiler)
```
download from http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/downloads/list
standard ./configure, make, make install
```

### gold

gold is highly recommended as a faster linker.  Pyston contains build-system support for automatically using gold if available.  gold may already be installed on your system; you can check by typing `which gold`.  If it's not installed already:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.24.tar.gz
tar xvf binutils-2.24.tar.gz
mkdir binutils-2.24-build
cd binutils-2.24-build
../binutils-2.24/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror
make all-gold -j4
```

If that last step fails due to complaints about YYSTYPE, try upgrading or installing bison (`sudo apt-get install bison`), removing the binutils-2.24-build directory, and configure + make again.

### perf
The `perf` tool is the best way we've found to profile JIT'd code; you can find more details in docs/PROFILING.

```
sudo apt-get install linux-tools
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-`uname -r`
# may need to strip off the -generic from that last one
```
