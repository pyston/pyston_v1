Pyston currently only supports installing from source; the following instructions have fairly tested as working on Ubuntu, and are extensively verified as not working on Mac.  (Please see issue [#165](https://github.com/dropbox/pyston/issues/165) for discussion on enabling OSX support, which is pretty difficult.)

The build instructions assume that you will put the Pyston source code in `~/pyston` and put the dependencies in `~/pyston_deps`.  If you want to change the dependency dir, you'll have to change the value of the the `DEPS_DIR` variable in `CMakeLists.txt`.

# CMake build system

We use a Makefile as a sort of "lite development environment"; it helps manage multiple cmake configurations and has some testing helpers.

### Prerequisites

**Ubuntu 12.04**
```
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
sudo apt-get -qq update

sudo apt-get install -yq git cmake ninja-build ccache libncurses5-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libgmp3-dev autoconf libtool python-dev texlive-extra-utils clang-3.4 libstdc++-4.8-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config
```


**Ubuntu 14.04/14.10/15.04**
```
sudo apt-get install -yq git cmake ninja-build ccache libncurses5-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libgmp3-dev autoconf libtool python-dev texlive-extra-utils clang libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config
```

**Fedora 21**
```
sudo yum install cmake clang gcc gcc-c++ ccache ninja-build xz-devel automake libtool gmp-devel readline-devel openssl-devel sqlite-devel python-devel zlib-devel
```

### Building and testing
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dropbox/pyston.git ~/pyston

git clone git://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm.git ~/pyston_deps/llvm-trunk
git clone git://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang.git ~/pyston_deps/llvm-trunk/tools/clang

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

cd ~/pyston
make llvm_up
make
make check
```

If the final `make check` doesn't pass, please let us know!

See the main README for more information about available make targets and options.


#### CMake options

- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (defaults to Release)
- `-DENABLE_LLVM_DEBUG=1` for full LLVM debug
- `-DENABLE_CCACHE=0` to disable ccache

# Optional dependencies

There are a number of optional dependencies that the build system knows about, but aren't strictly necessary for building and running Pyston.  Most of them are related to developing and debugging:

### GCC 4.8.2

Pyston (and LLVM) requires a fairly modern [host compiler](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#host-c-toolchain-both-compiler-and-standard-library), so you will have to compile a recent GCC if it's not already available for your system. The easiest thing to do is to just create a fresh build of GCC:

```
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev make build-essential libtool zip gcc-multilib autogen
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gcc/gcc-4.8.2/gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2
tar xvf gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2
mkdir gcc-4.8.2-{build,install}
cd gcc-4.8.2-build
# Space- and time-saving configuration:
../gcc-4.8.2/configure --disable-bootstrap --enable-languages=c,c++ --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install
# full configuration:
# ../gcc-4.8.2/configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install
# Specifying LIBRARY_PATH is a workaround to get gcc to compile on newer Ubuntus with multiarch
LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32 make -j4
make check
make install
```


### gdb
A modern gdb is highly recommended; users on Ubuntu 12.04 should definitely update:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.6.2.tar.gz
tar xvf gdb-7.6.2.tar.gz
cd gdb-7.6.2
./configure
make -j4
cd ~/pyston
echo "GDB := \$(DEPS_DIR)/gdb-7.6.2/gdb/gdb --data-directory \$(DEPS_DIR)/gdb-7.6.2/gdb/data-directory" >> Makefile.local
```

#### getting gdb to pretty-print STL types

GDB ships with python scripts that tell it how to pretty-print STL containers, but they only work against the stdlib in the corresponding version of GCC. Unfortunately, we compile against an old version of gcc's C++ stdlib. Here's how to get GDB to use the *old* pretty-print scripts for GCC 4.8.2. (Note: Have only tested this with gdb 7.8.1-ubuntu4 and gcc-4.8.2.)

If you've built GCC, the GDB scripts will be in `~/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install/share/gcc-4.8.2/python`. Unfortunately they're for Python 2, and GDB 7.8.1 uses Python 3. So we'll use `2to3` to update them:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install/share/gcc-4.8.2/python/libstdcxx/v6
2to3 -w printers.py
```

Don't worry, `2to3` makes a backup of the file it changes if you need to go back. Now, edit your `~/.gdbinit` file to contain the following:

```
python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/YOUR/HOME/DIR/pyston_deps/gcc-4.8.2-install/share/gcc-4.8.2/python')
from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
register_libstdcxx_printers(None)
print('--- Registered cxx printers for gcc 4.8.2! ---')
```

And there you go!

### gold

gold is highly recommended as a faster linker, and Pyston contains build-system support for automatically using gold if available.  gold may already be installed on your system; you can check by typing `which gold`.  If it's not installed already:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
sudo apt-get install bison
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.24.tar.gz
tar xvf binutils-2.24.tar.gz
mkdir binutils-2.24-build
cd binutils-2.24-build
../binutils-2.24/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror
make all-gold -j4
```

### perf
The `perf` tool is the best way we've found to profile JIT'd code; you can find more details in docs/PROFILING.

```
sudo apt-get install linux-tools
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-`uname -r`
# may need to strip off the -generic from that last one
```

# Misc tools

These are only useful in specific development situations:

### valgrind

Since Pyston uses a custom memory allocator, it makes use of the valgrind client hooks to help valgrind understand it.  This means that you'll need a copy of the valgrind includes around; I also suggest that if you want to use valgrind, you use a recent version since there are some instructions that LLVM emits that somewhat-recent versions of valgrind don't understand.

To install:

```
cd ~/pyston_deps
wget http://valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.10.0.tar.bz2
tar xvf valgrind-3.10.0.tar.bz2
mkdir valgrind-3.10.0-install
cd valgrind-3.10.0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pyston_deps/valgrind-3.10.0-install
make -j4
make install
sudo apt-get install libc6-dbg
cd ~/pyston
echo "ENABLE_VALGRIND := 1" >> Makefile.local
```

### gperftools (-lprofiler)
```
download from http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/downloads/list
standard ./configure, make, make install
```

### Debug build of CPython

Having a debug-enabled CPython can be useful for debugging issues with our extension modules.  To get it set up:

```
sudo apt-get install python2.7-dbg
cd ~/pyston_deps
mkdir python-src
cd python-src
apt-get source python2.7-dbg
```

Then, run `make dbgpy_TESTNAME` and it will launch the test under gdb.  There's also a [wiki page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb) with some extra Python-specific GDB commands.

### doxygen
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

# then run cmake and invoke the docs target
ninja docs

# now within the Pyston build directory open docs/html/index.html with a browser
```
