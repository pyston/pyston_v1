The purpose is to hack the libffi sources so that they can be compiled
with MSVC, and to extend them so that they have the features I need
for ctypes.

I retrieved the libffi sources from the gcc cvs repository on
2004-01-27.  Then I did 'configure' in a 'build' subdirectory on a x86
linux system, and copied the files I found useful.
