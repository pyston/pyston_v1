# From SF bug #422121:  Insecurities in dict comparison.

# Safety of code doing comparisons has been an historical Python weak spot.
# The problem is that comparison of structures written in C *naturally*
# wants to hold on to things like the size of the container, or "the
# biggest" containee so far, across a traversal of the container; but
# code to do containee comparisons can call back into Python and mutate
# the container in arbitrary ways while the C loop is in midstream.  If the
# C code isn't extremely paranoid about digging things out of memory on
# each trip, and artificially boosting refcounts for the duration, anything
# from infinite loops to OS crashes can result (yes, I use Windows <wink>).
#
# The other problem is that code designed to provoke a weakness is usually
# white-box code, and so catches only the particular vulnerabilities the
# author knew to protect against.  For example, Python's list.sort() code
# went thru many iterations as one "new" vulnerability after another was
# discovered.
#
# So the dict comparison test here uses a black-box approach instead,
# generating dicts of various sizes at random, and performing random
# mutations on them at random times.  This proved very effective,
# triggering at least six distinct failure modes the first 20 times I
# ran it.  Indeed, at the start, the driver never got beyond 6 iterations
# before the test died.

# The dicts are global to make it easy to mutate tham from within functions.
dict1 = {}
dict2 = {}

# The current set of keys in dict1 and dict2.  These are materialized as
# lists to make it easy to pick a dict key at random.
dict1keys = []
dict2keys = []

# Global flag telling maybe_mutate() whether to *consider* mutating.
mutate = 0

# If global mutate is true, consider mutating a dict.  May or may not
# mutate a dict even if mutate is true.  If it does decide to mutate a
# dict, it picks one of {dict1, dict2} at random, and deletes a random
# entry from it; or, more rarely, adds a random element.
