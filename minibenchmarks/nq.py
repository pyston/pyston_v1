# choice between bitmaps and sets
#
# bitmaps are reresented natively as (long) ints in Python,
# thus bitmap operations are very very fast
#
# however for asymptotic complexity, x in bitmap operation is O(N) and x in set is O(logN)
#
# in my experience python function calls are expensive, thus the threshold where sets show benefit is rather high
# another possible explanation for high threshold is large memory size of Python dictionaries and thus frozensets,
# __sizeof__ for representaions of range(100):: set: 8K, frozenset: 4K, (2 ** 100): 40 bytes
#
# for 8x8 board, a 64-bit bitmap wins by a large margin
# IMO 10x10 board is still faster with bitmaps


# all queens are equivalent, thus solution (Q1, Q2, Q3) == (Q1, Q3, Q2)

# then, let's do an exhaustive search with early pruning:
# consider board of 4 [ , , , ] for 3 queens
# position [ , ,Q1, ] will never generate a solution, because there's no space for both Q2 and Q3 left
# likewise, let's extend concept of "space" along 4 dimensions -- rows, cols, diag, gaid
